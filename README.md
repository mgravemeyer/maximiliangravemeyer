# Personal Website

This is my personal website. It is built with Next.js using Typescript, Tailwind, and the i18n package for translations. Using this tech stack is completely overkill for a portfolio website. However, I chose to use these technologies because I see this website more as my playground, where I can explore and test some next.js/tailwind features.
